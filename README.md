## 1. What are _Machine Learning Design Patterns_?

**Machine Learning Design Patterns** aim to provide reusable solutions to common machine-learning problems. Drawing from various disciplines, they offer a principled approach for building robust, accurate, and scalable ML systems.

### Key Elements of Machine Learning Design Patterns

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Dividing the problem into subtasks such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation.
  
2. **Algorithm Selection and Configuration**: Choosing the right ML algorithm, along with its hyperparameters, based on the data and task.

3. **Data Management and Processing**: Strategies for handling large datasets, data cleaning, and error-correction methods.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Assessing and choosing the best models, which may also include ensembling for enhanced performance.

5. **Model Interpretability and Explainability**: Techniques to make models more transparent and understandable.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Approaches to enhance model efficiency and scalability. This might involve strategies like gradient clipping in deep learning for more stable training.

7. **Reproducibility, Testing, and Debugging**: Ensuring results are consistent across experiments and strategies for identifying and rectifying errors.

8. **MLOps Considerations**: Integrating ML models into production systems, automating the workflow, continuous monitoring, and ensuring model robustness and reliability.

### Common Patterns in Machine Learning

#### Data Management and Processing

- **Data Binning**: For continuous data, divide it into discrete intervals, or bins, to simplify data and compensates for outliers.
  
- **Bucketing**: Create predefined groups or "buckets" to categorize data points, making them more manageable and improving interpretability.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transform categorical variables into binary vectors with a single "1" indicating the presence of a particular category.
<br>

## 2. Can you explain the concept of the '_Baseline_' design pattern?

The **Baseline** pattern represents a straightforward and effective starting point for various **Machine Learning** models. It emphasizes the importance of establishing a performance baseline, often achieved by using straightforward, rule-based, or even basic statistical models before exploring more complex ones.

### Key Components

- **Metrics**: Quantify model performance.
- **Features and Labels**: Understand input-output relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize and handle missing values.

### Benefits

- **Performance Benchmark**: Serves as a measuring stick for more elaborate models.
- **Explainability**: Generally simple models provide interpretability.
- **Robustness**: A basic model can withstand data distribution shifts.

### Code Example: Baseline Regression

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train baseline model (simple linear regression)
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Perform predictions
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Calculate MSE (baseline metric)
mse_baseline = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Baseline MSE: {mse_baseline:.2f}")
```
<br>

## 3. Describe the '_Feature Store_' design pattern and its advantages.

**Feature Stores** act as centralized repositories for machine learning features, offering numerous advantages in the ML development lifecycle.

### Advantages of a Feature Store

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures that both training and real-time systems use consistent feature values.
  
- **Improved Efficiency**: Caches and precomputes features to speed up both training and inference operations.
  
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitates feature sharing among team members and across projects.
  
- **Automated Feature Management**: Simplifies governance, lineage tracking, and feature versioning.

### Feature Store Components

1. **Feature Repository**: Acts as the primary data store for the features. This repository can be a NoSQL database, an RDBMS, a distributed file system, or even a simple in-memory cache, depending on the specific requirements of the application.

2. **Metadata Store**: Contains details about the features, such as data types, statistical properties, and feature lineage. This metadata is crucial for modeling and ensuring consistency across different stages, like training and inference.

3. **Data Ingestion**: Handles the automation of data pipelines that fetch, preprocess, and update the features. It also manages versioning, ensuring the data used for inference matches the data used for training.

4. **Data Serving**: Provides low-latency access to the features in production systems. This means it needs to support efficient data serving strategies, like caching and indexing.

### Code Example: Feature Management

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Define a simple feature class
class Feature:
    def __init__(self, name, dtype, description=""):
        self.name = name
        self.dtype = dtype
        self.description = description

# Metadata for Features
feature_metadata = {
    'age': Feature('age', 'int', 'Customer age'),
    'gender': Feature('gender', 'str', 'Customer gender'),
    'location': Feature('location', 'str', 'Location of customer')
}

# Wrap features with metadata in a Feature Store
class FeatureStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.features = feature_metadata
        self.feature_data = {}
    
    def fetch_feature(self, name):
        return self.feature_data.get(name, None)
    
    def update_feature_data(self, name, data):
        self.feature_data[name] = data

# Using the Feature Store: Ingest and Serve Data
my_feature_store = FeatureStore()

# Simulate data ingestion
sample_data = {
    'age': 25,
    'gender': 'Male',
    'location': 'New York'
}

for feature, value in sample_data.items():
    my_feature_store.update_feature_data(feature, value)

# Serve feature data
for feature in sample_data.keys():
    print(f"{feature}: {my_feature_store.fetch_feature(feature)}")
```

In this code example, we define a `FeatureStore` class that manages feature metadata and data. We then simulate data ingestion and serving through the feature store. Note that this is a simplified example, and actual feature store implementations are more complex.
<br>

## 4. How does the '_Pipelines_' design pattern help in structuring ML workflows?

**Pipelines** in Machine Learning refer to end-to-end workflows that encompass steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

The **Pipelines design pattern** streamlines these multi-stage workflows and offers several advantages for reproducibility, maintainability, and efficiency.

### Key Benefits

- **Standardization**: Promotes consistency across multiple experiments.
  
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies complex workflows, making them easier to comprehend and manage.
  
- **Reproducibility**: Makes it straightforward to reproduce the same results.

- **Automation**: Automates various processes, including feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Core Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, standardization, and transformation steps.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Construction of new features and their selection.
  
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Application of machine learning algorithms and evaluation through performance metrics.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model-specific parameters to enhance performance.

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Clean the dataset to remove any inconsistencies.
    - Standardize or normalize numeric features.
    - Encode categorical variables, such as using one-hot encoding.
    - Handle missing data, via imputation or exclusion.
  
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
    - Generate new features from existing ones.
    - **Select** relevant features for the model.
  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
    - Split the dataset into training and testing splits
    - Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
    - Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters for better performance.

### Code Example: Scikit-Learn Pipeline

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Sample data
X, y = ...

# Define the steps in the pipeline
numeric_features = ...
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())])

categorical_features = ...
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='missing')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))])

# Combine different transformers using ColumnTransformer
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)])

# Create the final pipeline by combining preprocessing and model training
pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                           ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier())])

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Fit the pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'Classification Report:\n{classification_report(y_test, y_pred)}')

# Perform Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
param_grid = {...}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
<br>

## 5. Discuss the purpose of the '_Replay_' design pattern in machine learning.

The **Replay Design Pattern** retrieves training data for the model in a timely manner, potentially improving model quality.

### When to Use It

- A **Continuous Data Provider** ensures the model is trained on the most recent, relevant data. For example, when making stock predictions, using recent data is crucial.

- **Data Efficiency**: The pattern is suitable in cases where data is costly or difficult to obtain, and new data can replace or be combined with old.

### Code Example: Replay Consideration for Stock Price Prediction

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load training data
historical_data = pd.read_csv('historical_stock_data.csv')

# Set training window (e.g., past 30 days)
end_date = datetime.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

# Filter training instances within the window
training_data_latest = historical_data[(historical_data['Date'] >= start_date) & (historical_data['Date'] <= end_date)]

# Train model with the latest training data
model.train(training_data_latest)
```
<br>

## 6. Explain the '_Model Ensemble_' design pattern and when you would use it.

**Model ensembling** involves combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance. 

### Common Techniques

- **Averaging/Aggregation**:  Combine each model's predictions, often with equal weights.
- **Weighted Averaging**: Each model gets a different weight in the final decision, generally based on its performance.
- **Voting**: This works especially well for classification problems. Models "vote" on the correct answer, and the answer with the majority of votes wins.
- **Stacking**: Involves training a meta-learner on the predictions of base models.        

### Code Example: Model Ensembling Methods

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Averaging
averaged_predictions = sum(model.predict(test_data) for model in models) / len(models)

# Voting for classification
from collections import Counter
final_predictions = [Counter(votes).most_common(1)[0][0] for votes in zip(*(model.predict(test_data) for model in models))]

# Stacking with sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import StackingClassifier
stacked_model = StackingClassifier(estimators=[('model1', model1), ('model2', model2)], final_estimator=final_estimator)
stacked_model.fit(train_data, train_target)
stacked_predictions = stacked_model.predict(test_data)
```
<br>

## 7. Describe the '_Checkpoint_' design pattern in the context of machine learning training.

Automating the repetitive tasks in the training phase of machine learning models can save a lot of time and avoid errors.

One such design pattern is the **Checkpoint**, which is critical for ensuring the efficiency and the robustness of the training process. The pattern helps to manage model transitions and to restart training from a stable state, thereby reducing unnecessary computation and resource expenses.

**Checkpoint** saves essential training parameters and states, enabling you to:

- **Resume Training**: Commence training from where it was last interrupted.
- **Ensure Configuration Consistency**: Checkpointed models include their respective configuration settings (such as optimizer states and learning rates), ensuring consistency which can be crucial, especially in distributed or multi-step training.
- **Support Ensembling**: Facilitates model ensembling by allowing you to combine models from various training stages.
- **Enable Model Rollback**: Easily revert to a stable model should performance deteriorate.

In TensorFlow, Keras, and other machine learning frameworks, the **Checkpoint** pattern is usually implemented through dedicated utilities like `ModelCheckpoint` (for Keras) or `tf.train.Checkpoint` (in TensorFlow).

Here are the key steps and the corresponding code using **TensorFlow**:

### Key Steps in Checkpointing

1. **Initialize Checkpoint**: Define a checkpoint object, stating which parameters to monitor.
  
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

   checkpoint_path = "training/cp.ckpt"
   checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(filepath=checkpoint_path, save_weights_only=True, 
                                monitor='val_accuracy', save_best_only=True)
   ```

2. **Integrate with Training Loop**: In Keras, this attaching is often handled by the fit method, while in a custom loop in TensorFlow, you apply the checkpoint object routinely during training.

   ```python
   model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data, callbacks=[checkpoint])
   ```

   or

   ```python
   for epoch in range(10):
       # Training steps go here
       # Validate model at the end of each epoch
       model.save_weights(checkpoint_path)
   ```

3. **Utilize Saved States**: To restore model states, you can use the `load_weights` method or `model.load_weights(checkpoint_path)`.

4. **Additional Configuration**: You might want to customize the checkpointing by considering different Keras callbacks or TensorFlow features. This can include saving at specific, non-epoch intervals or saving just the weights or the entire model.

   ```python
   checkpoint_weights = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.hdf5", monitor='val_loss', save_weights_only=True)
   ```

5. **Continued and Multi-Stage Training**: In certain scenarios, you might need to continue the training from the precise point where you stopped before. This could be due to the interruption of the training process or as a part of multi-stage training.

   ```python
   latest = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)
   model.load_weights(latest)
   model.fit(train_data, epochs=5, callbacks=[checkpoint])  # This continues the training
   ```

### Tip

- Remember to periodically update the checkpoint file's path to avoid overwriting valuable states from earlier training sessions.
<br>

## 8. What is the '_Batch Serving_' design pattern and where is it applied?

**Batch Serving** is a design pattern employed in **Machine Learning systems** where predictions are completed efficiently but not necessarily in real-time.

### Key Characteristics

- **Mode**: Off-line.
- **Latency**: Concern is not real-time, focusing instead on efficient, batch processing.
- **Data Fidelity**: Only historical data influences the predictions.

### Applications

- **Data Science Pipelines**: It's often the first step in modern machine learning pipelines, where raw data from databases or data lakes is preprocessed (feature extraction, normalization, etc.) in batches before being used for training, validation, or inference.
 
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Online learning algorithms can use batch learning in cases where models need to be updated in a dynamic way to adapt to new data frequently. In such settings, the model is updated with small, recent batches of data but occasionally retrained on full batches to ensure stability and generalization.

### Code Example: Batch Prediction with Scikit-Learn

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate a Random Forest model
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make batch predictions
batch_pred = rf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the predictions
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, batch_pred)
print(f"Batch prediction accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
<br>

## 9. Explain the '_Transformation_' design pattern and its significance in data preprocessing.

The **Transformation** design pattern is a fundamental approach employed in data preprocessing to **modify features** and optimize dataset suitability for machine learning algorithms. By performing various transformations, such as scaling numerical features or encoding categorical ones, this pattern ensures that your data is consistent and in a format that machine learning models can readily utilize.

### Why Transform Data?

- **Algorithmic Requirements**: Many machine learning algorithms have specific data format requirements.
  
- **Performance Improvement**: Rescaling attributes within specific ranges, for example, can lead to better model performance.

- **Feature Generation**: New attributes can be generated from existing ones to improve predictive capability.

### Common Transformations

1. **Scaling**: Bringing features onto the same scale is especially essential for algorithms leveraging distances or gradients. Common techniques include Z-score scaling and Min-Max scaling.

2. **Normalization**: Normalizing data to a unit length can be advantageous. For instance, cosine similarity works particularly well with normalized data.

3. **Handling Categorical Data**: Categorical data requires special treatment; it might be encoded numerically or with techniques such as one-hot encoding.

4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Deploying methods to counter class imbalance, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), can alleviate biases in the training data.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: High-dimensional data can be challenging for certain algorithms. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce dimensions without losing too much information.

6. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest. Their presence can severely degrade model performance, so they must be identified and managed.

7. **Feature Engineering**: Sometimes, the existing features can be combined, or new ones can be derived to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

### Code Example: Common Data Transformations

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# 1. Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# 2. Categorical Data Handling
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_categorical)

# 3. Dimensionality Reduction
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

# 4. Outlier Detection and Removal
# This can be done with, for example, the IsolationForest algorithm or Z-score method.

# 5. Feature Engineering
# e.g., if we have 'age' and 'income', we can create a new feature 'wealth' as 'age' * 'income'.
```

### Key Takeaways

- Transformation is a crucial data preprocessing pattern that ensures the data is in a format most suitable for the machine learning model.
- A range of transformations exists, from handling categorical variables to managing outliers, each serving a unique purpose in tuning the data.
- Building a **pipeline** that integrates these transformation steps alongside the model can streamline the entire workflow, ensuring consistent and accurate data preparation for both training and inference.
<br>

## 10. How does the '_Regularization_' design pattern help in preventing overfitting?

**Regularization** helps in preventing overfitting by **introducing a penalty for complexity** during model training. This allows for more generalizable models, especially in situations with limited data.

### Background

The problem of **overfitting** arises from models becoming too tailored to the training data, making them less effective when faced with unseen data during testing or real-world use.

Regularization methods evolved as a way to curb this overemphasis on the training data and these are particularly beneficial when working with high-dimensional feature spaces or small datasets.

### Mechanism

Regularization works by **augmenting the training objective** to include a measure of complexity, along with the standard error measure.

1. **Loss Function**: Measures the difference between predicted and actual values.
   - **Mean Squared Error** (MSE) in the case of linear regression.

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

2. **Regularization Term**: Adds a penalty for increased model complexity, often resembling the $L_1$ or $L_2$ norms of the model's parameters.

   - **$L_1$ Regularization** (Lasso): Penalizes the absolute value of model coefficients.

$$
L1 = \lambda\sum_{i=1}^{m}\|w_i\|
$$

   - **$L_2$ Regularization** (Ridge): Penalizes the squared magnitude of model coefficients.

$$
L2 = \lambda\sum_{i=1}^{m}w_i^2
$$

The overall objective for model optimization, thus, becomes a balance between minimizing the loss (to fit the data well) and constraining the model complexity.

### Code Example: L1 and L2 Regularization

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Import relevant modules
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=0.1, random_state=0)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=32)

# Instantiate models with different types of regularization
lasso_model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)  # L1 regularization
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)  # L2 regularization

# Fit the models on training data
lasso_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_lasso = lasso_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_ridge = ridge_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate models
mse_lasso = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_lasso)
mse_ridge = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_ridge)

print("MSE for Lasso (L1) Regularization Model: ", mse_lasso)
print("MSE for Ridge (L2) Regularization Model: ", mse_ridge)
```
<br>

## 11. What is the '_Workload Isolation_' design pattern and why is it important?

**Workload Isolation** is a design pattern that ensures that **individual models**, **datasets**, or **processing methods** are kept separate to optimize their performance and guarantee specialized attention.

### Key Components

- **Specialized Models**: Train separate models for distinct aspects of the data. For instance, identifying fraud in financial transactions and approving legitimate ones require different models.

- **Dedicated Datasets**: Maintain distinct sets of data to ensure that each model is well-suited to its designated task.

- **Isolated Infrastructure**: Employ separate resources such as CPU, memory, and GPUs for each model.

### Illustrative Example: Multi-Tenant Cloud Service

Consider a cloud-based prediction service catering to multiple clients. Each client may have unique requirements, and their data needs to be processed with dedicated models in an isolated environment to ensure privacy and performance.

### Code Example: Workload Isolation in Cloud Service

Here is the Python code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from sklearn.externals import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load different models for different tenants
model_tenant_1 = joblib.load('tenant_1_model.pkl')
model_tenant_2 = joblib.load('tenant_2_model.pkl')

@app.route('/tenant_1/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_tenant_1():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model_tenant_1.predict(data)
    return {'prediction': prediction}

@app.route('/tenant_2/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_tenant_2():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model_tenant_2.predict(data)
    return {'prediction': prediction}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
<br>

## 12. Describe the '_Shadow Model_' design pattern and when it should be used.

In **Machine Learning**, the **Shadow Model** design pattern describes a risk management strategy employed by organizations to mitigate potential issues during the adoption and deployment of ML solutions. It involves the parallel execution of a traditional rules-based system alongside the ML model, allowing real-time comparison and ensuring consistent performance and safety.

### When to Use the Shadow Model Design Pattern

- **Transition Periods**: Ideal for gradual migration from a legacy rules-based system to a more dynamic ML-driven system.
- **Risk-Sensitive Applications** Risk-averse or high-stakes domains, such as finance or healthcare, benefit from an additional layer of validation and interpretability.
- **Model Continuous Assessment**: Allows for ongoing evaluation of the ML model, detecting performance degradation or mismatches between model predictions and rule-based decisions which is important for monitoring and maintenance.
- **Delegated Decision Making**: When the ML model provides recommendations, and final decisions are confirmed by a rule-based system, the shadow model offers backup validation.

### Code Example: Shadow Model

In this example, we simulate the operation of a shadow model in a classification setting. The shadow model uses a simple rule to predict class labels, while the primary model employs a more complex, potentially black-box, algorithm.

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X, y = np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.choice([0, 1], 100)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize primary model and shadow model
primary_model = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train)
shadow_rule = lambda x: 1 if x[0] > 0.5 else 0

# Compare predictions
primary_predictions = primary_model.predict(X_test)
shadow_predictions = np.array([shadow_rule(row) for row in X_test])

# Assess the primary's accuracy and compare with shadow
primary_accuracy = np.mean(primary_predictions == y_test)
shadow_accuracy = np.mean(shadow_predictions == y_test)

print(f"Primary model accuracy: {primary_accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Shadow model (rule-based) accuracy: {shadow_accuracy:.2f}")
```

In this simulation, the primary model and shadow model make predictions based on test data identical to the real-time workflow in a production system. These predictions' accuracies are then compared to evaluate the consistency of the two models, supporting the need for a shadow model in various applications.

## 13. Explain the '_Data Versioning_' design pattern and its role in model reproducibility.

**Data Versioning** is a crucial design pattern for **ensuring model reproducibility** in Machine Learning. It involves systematically capturing, tracking, and managing changes made to your training data.

### Importance of Data Versioning

- **Reproducibility**: Links specific data snapshots to model versions for audit and replication purposes.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Necessary for meeting industry regulations and internal policies.
- **Augmenting Training Sets**: Integrated with data augmentation and curation.

### Challenges in Data Management

1. **Size and Complexity**: Datasets can be enormous, with countless derived versions from pre-processing and feature engineering.

2. **Diversity and Incompatibility**: Datasets may combine structured and unstructured data, making unified management challenging.

3. **Dynamic Nature**: Data is subject to change beyond initial acquisition, warranting tracking to detect and handle these changes.

### Strategies for Data Versioning

- **Data Backup**: Using file systems or cloud storage to archive data, allowing recovery to previous versions.

- **Database Transaction Logs (Undo-Redo)**: Records of data changes, offering the ability to undo or redo modifications.

- **Data Transformation Logs (Provenance)**: Capturing transformations and association with derived datasets to trace their lineage.

- **Content-Based Hashing**: Creates checksums based on data content, with identical content yielding the same hash. This validates data accuracy but lacks temporal context.

### Approaches to Data Versioning

- **Content-Based Checksums**: Suitable for static data but not ideal when datasets evolve over time.

- **Time-Stamped Data**: Tracks data versions using timestamps, offering temporal context but necessitating precision in timestamps across diverse locations.

- **ID-Based Data**: A more robust approach where each unique dataset state is assigned a unique identifier (ID), offering a clear data lineage.

### Code Example: Data Versioning

Here is the Python code:

```python
import hashlib
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

class VersionedData:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.versions = {}  # Stores data versions along with their timestamps

    def record_version(self):
        version_id = hashlib.md5(str(datetime.now()).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
        self.versions[version_id] = datetime.now()
        return version_id

    def rollback(self, version_id):
        if version_id in self.versions:
            timestamp = self.versions[version_id]
            # Restore data to the version corresponding to the provided timestamp
        else:
            return "Invalid version ID. Rollback failed."
```

In this example, we create a `VersionedData` class that wraps a data object and maintains a history of versions with associated timestamps using content-based hashing and time-stamping. The `record_version` method generates a unique version identifier based on the current timestamp, and the `rollback` method can restore the data to a specific version using the associated version identifier.

## 14. How is the â€˜_Evaluation Store_â€™ design pattern applied to keep track of model performances?

The **Evaluation Store** design pattern is a powerful tool for managing model performance information, making it invaluable for any **Machine Learning** workflow. It **prioritizes convenience, transparency, and reproducibility**.

### Core Components

- **Database**: Usually a structured database management system (DBMS) such as **SQL** or **NoSQL** varieties like **MongoDB**.
- **Storage**: Crucial for storing trained models, metadata, and evaluation results.

### Key Tasks

- **Data Ingestion**: Compilation and storage of various datasets.
- **Model Training**: Execution and recording of training sequences, including model and metadata storage.
- **Evaluation & Feedback**: Post-training analysis, base on which automated feedback on improving model performance can be constructed.

### Code Example: Evaluation Store

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Data Ingestion
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Store metadata (if necessary)
metadata = {"description": "Iris dataset for training a classification model"}
metadata_df = pd.DataFrame(metadata, index=[0])

# Model Training
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate and store results in a SQL database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
conn = engine.connect()
results = {"accuracy": accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))}
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results, index=[0])

metadata_df.to_sql("metadata", con=conn)
results_df.to_sql("evaluation_results", con=conn)
```

## 15. What is the '_Adaptation_' design pattern and how does it use historical data?

The **Adaptation** design pattern, also known as **AutoML-based Learning**, uniquely leverages **historical data** in the model training and testing process.

### **Key Components**

1. **Algorithms Brick**: Distinct modeling strategies, tailored to the task, that the AutoML system can choose from.
2.  **Fine-Tuning Stewart**: Consists of automated methodologies for hyperparameter tuning, which may include evolutionary algorithms, grid search, or Bayesian optimization.
3.  **Data Brick**: The historical dataset used for module initialization as well as for validation.


### Benefits

- **Anticipatory Learning**: The model can dynamically adapt to changing data distributions and concept drift.
- **Efficiency**: Training on the available historical data can be much faster than iterative training methods.
- **Robustness**: Incorporating a broad historical context can make the model resilient to noise and outliers.

### Example: Google Cloud AutoML

Google Cloud's AutoML, a prominent example of the Adaptation design pattern, uses re-training and access to BigQuery to accommodate evolving data distributions and improve model accuracy.
